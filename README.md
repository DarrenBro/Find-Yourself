I tried the following ideas, ran out of time to get them working however.

1. "EllipseMoving.pde" => The liberty logo moves around in front of 'endframecrop2.jpg'.
   But I wanted the moving image to make the background image appear, like a whitewash effect.

2. "AttemptAt007Pixels.pde" => Tried to use pixels to make the center focus like the 007 shot.
   Then have it move around slowly focusing on certain areas of 'endframecrop2.jpg'.

3. "LibertySortCodeFinal.pde" => Did some refactoring.

* Other idea => Use pixels to make the image come into focus over time.
